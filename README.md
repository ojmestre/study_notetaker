# Semi-Automated Note Taker
A semi-automated note taker application for observational usability and research studies.

<h2> The Need </h2>
<p>
  During observational studies, like usability assessments or cognitive walkthroughs, human systems researchers needed a quick way to log observations, notes and key milestones during the execution of the study in order to provide meaningful data analysis and feedback. 
</p>

<h3> Background </h3>
<p>
  Studies for this team involve human systems researchers observing operator interactions with user interface displays, other operators, supervisors and other systems as well.  Tracking the different verbal and visual interactions of one or multiple operators is difficult, and human systems researchers typically fell behind while taking manual notes.  A semi-automated note taking application allows them to log pre-determined, time-stamped observations, milestones and notes.
</p>

<h2> Methods </h2>
<p>
  This effort was a collaboration between internal developers, human systems researchers, and other teams within our agency, once word of the application development got out!  When more teams expressed their desire for an application like this, we took a step back and developed use cases and user stories to make sure we could fulfill each teams needs. After having a set of requirements outlined, wireframing and mockups began.
</p>
  
<h2> The Benefits </h2>
<p>
  This project is still in the works and already having benefits - we keep seeing an increased interest and need for the application, so we're excited about its development.  This is just a first pass at some general layouts and what we think it will start to look like.  Ideally, this application will allow researchers to build their own interface that is specific to their research study.
